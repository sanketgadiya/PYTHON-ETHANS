(1) Write a Python program to find a missing number from a list.  
Input : [1,2,3,4,6,7,8]
Output : 5

(2) Write a Python program to find missing numbers from a list. 
Input : [1,2,3,4,6,7,10]
Output : [5, 8, 9]

(3) Write a Python program to add the digits of a positive integer repeatedly until the result has a single digit. 
Input : 48
Output : 3
For example given number is 59, the result will be 5.
Step 1: 5 + 9 = 14
Step 1: 1 + 4 = 5

(4) Write a Python program to check a sequence of numbers is an arithmetic progression or not. 
Input : [5, 7, 9, 11]
Output : True
In mathematics, an arithmetic progression or arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between the consecutive terms is constant.
For example, the sequence 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 ... is an arithmetic progression with common difference of 2.

(5) Write a Python program to push all zeros to the end of a list. 
Input : [0,2,3,4,6,7,10]
Output : [2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 0]

Expected Output: [10, 11, 12]

(12) Write a Python program to insert a given string at the beginning of all items in a list. 
Sample list : [1,2,3,4], string : emp
Expected output : ['emp1', 'emp2', 'emp3', 'emp4']

(13) Write a Python program to match key values in two dictionaries. 
Sample dictionary: {'key1': 1, 'key2': 3, 'key3': 2}, {'key1': 1, 'key2': 2}
Expected output: key1: 1 is present in both x and y
